        The historical research and organizing impetus for this tour was
        provided by Walter Cassidy of the Windsor Essex Rainbow Alliance (WERA).
        The tour app was built using the Pytheas project. This open-source code
        was provided to the community by Parallel 42 Systems based on their work
        with the McDougall Corridor tour app, built in partnership with the
        Essex County Black Historical Research Society, the Windsor Law Centre
        for Cities, the School of Creative Arts (SOCA), and Leddy Library, with
        funding provided by Canada's federal government through the Canadian
        Urban Institute.

        Tibbitts, and Zhenia Tom√©, with funding and support from Parallel 42
