It started out of the “condom committee” of the Lesbian/Gay Community Service Group (LGCSG). There was some debate on what they should call the new institution. Jim Monk liked the phrase, AIDS Committee of Essex. His rationale was to make sure to incorporate the county. Wayne Tennant saw that the acronym ACE could be linked to the Ace of Spades playing card. Which also could be connected to the death card in the tarot. So, the idea was dropped.", "The founding members were Jim Monk, Barry Adam, John Dufour, Wayne Tennant, Colleen Gallagher with Kevin Bishop, and Beth Lyster who also applied for funding. Wayne Tennant was the first Chairman of the ACW.", "The group started out of Jim Monks house. He worked the line at night, so his place was available during the day.", "Kevin Bishop applied for funding to receive money to employ an Executive Director.  There was no interview process, just a show of interest. It was decided by the founders that Bishop would be the first. He was young and hadn't started any major financial career like most of the others.", "Once they had the Ex. Director, they needed to find a place of their own. The group had a very difficult time finding anyone who would rent to them. They even had a realtor to help them find a place but when they were open about to the space about the group, they wouldn't rent to them.  Most places didn't want anything to do with an AIDS organization."], "image": "/photos/acw.png"}
