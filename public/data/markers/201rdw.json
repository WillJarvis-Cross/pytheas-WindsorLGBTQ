It included workshops and public forums. One was done here at St. Clair College Centre for the Arts, and one was done at Walkerville High School on teaching AIDS in schools. It was a very small turn out and very few educators attended. Kevin Brown was the first Windsorite to come out publicly about having AIDS. While living in Vancouver, he became the first person in Canada to receive AZT treatment. He was also the founder of BC Persons with AIDS Coalition. He did not live in Windsor at this time but came home to visit family. He later died in 1989. In 2017, Windsor hosted the International GSA Conference “Outshine.”", "image": "/photos/201rdw.png"}
