In 1842, this was also the site of Canada's first documented conviction of “homosexual sex between two consenting adults.” They were Lance Corporal Samuel Moore and Private Patrick Kelly of the 89th Regiment. There is no record of the two of them specifically at Fort Malden, but their regiment is recorded to be there at this time. Their trial was convened in Sandwich town, and they were to be put to death on July 15th of that year. However, the Governor General became involved and commuted their sentence to life in prison, and both men were sent to the Kingston Penitentiary. Moore was later released in 1849 and Kelly was released in 1853. In 1990, the first Day Without Art was observed in Windsor at MacKenzie Hall. Later, in 1994, WIGGLE (an annual Wig Festival) was founded. This festival was created as a fundraiser for the Arts Council of Windsor, and performed at the Masonic Temple. It continues today in Montreal.", "image": "/photos/mhcc1.png"}
