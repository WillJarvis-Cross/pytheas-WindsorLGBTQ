{"id": "ws", "url": null, "description": "In 1945, the first of the Windsor Slasher murders were discovered. This was the first known serial killer in Canada who specifically targeted queer men. The killer would approach them in Riverside parks and stab them repeatedly in the back. George Mannie, Frank Sciegliski, and Sgt. Hugh Blackwood Price were the first three victims. In 1946, the slasher attacks continued with Alexander Voligny and Joseph Gelencser. The murderer was ultimately caught in September of that year.", "timeline": null, "image": null}
