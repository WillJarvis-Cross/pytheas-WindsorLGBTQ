Soon after, the first local Gay discrimination protest happened outside the hotel. It was organized by members of the Windsor Gay Unity.", "In 1982, the first reported case of AIDS in Canada was reported in Windsor at the Hotel Dieu Hospital. He was a 43-year-old Gay man.", "October 1953 was the first recorded gender affirming surgery performed in Windsor. Marie Francis Jefferson who publicly called herself Canada’s Christine Jorgenson was operated on by Dr. Walter L. Percival. It was a two-hour operation. Jefferson was in the hospital for over a month recovering.  When she was well enough for the first time, she walked along Ouellette Avenue in women’s clothes. She thought everyone was looking at her “but I felt I was doing the right thing.” After the operation she was put on hormones. When she reflected on her journey “I think the operation I had done in Windsor, that finally made me a woman.”  When she got out of the hospital her parents went to see her and they walked right past her because they didn’t recognize her.", "Jefferson was born on July 30th, 1929, in Bridgetown, Nova Scotia. Her experience based on today’s standards would have classified her identity as Intersex. Jefferson was “born with both male and female characteristics.” At birth her mother had 12 doctors called in to decide on her sex and advised her mother to bring Marie up as a boy. But Jackson never felt like a boy and started to develop breasts during puberty.  The doctors at the time decided to operate on her and removed them. She greatly regretted that decision later in life and so did her future Windsor doctor. Jefferson’s story is one of those small percentages of Intersex experiences that intersect with the Trans experience."], "timeline": null, "image": "/photos/1150oa1.png"}
