It now has churches in over 37 countries and 200 places around the world. Its first church in Canada was in Toronto in 1973. The first church in Detroit was in 1972 and was attended by many Windsorites.", "MCC has been one the most important local groups to the community for decades. It started in Windsor on January 8th, 1988, under the leadership of Rev. Don McRae. MCC had their first local service at Iona College.", "The goal of the Windsor MCC was to provide a spiritual home for the Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender communities and for all who choose to join us through the practicing of the gospel of Jesus Christ in worship, prayer, social action, education, fellowship, and generosity so that all people might experience God's liberating love, wholeness, and justice; come to live in right relationship with God and all creation; and have the courage to change the world.", "Before he became a Reverend for MCC, McRae was a Salvationist in Leamington. He got married to a woman at the time because of the Salvation Army said the only way to become an officer he would have a bride. The marriage ended in divorce after 5 years. Years later, living in Toronto, he connected with Brett Hawkes the MCC leader in Toronto. Robin Sherman, an early parishioner of MCC told me that at the time, MCC in Toronto was wanting to expand the church in other areas. McRae and his partner Tony Dias ended up moving to Windsor with $100.00 that the MCC Toronto gave them. They first had a couple services at Iona Collage to see if there was an interest in Windsor. There was, so both had their day jobs transfer them to Windsor and off they went. McRae headed the local Windsor group until he began to get sick. Deacon Diane Skomash took over while he was too sick to work. McRae died of complications from AIDS in 1994. The church moved around over the years such as Mackenzie Hall back to Iona College then MCC found this space.", "For decades MCC Windsor has been a prominent fixture in the Queer/Trans community. Organizing events in the 1990s and having services on Sunday morning during Pride. It still exists today but at a much smaller level than it did in the past. Their existence has been seen throughout community events and city organizations and including having a presence in pride endeavours around the city and county."], "timeline": {"header": "List of Pastoral Leaders of MCC:", "list": ["1988 - 1994: Rev Don McRae", "1994 - 1996: Deacon Diane Skomash", "1996 - 1999:  Rev.
