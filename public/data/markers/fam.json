The city was involved, and the current mayor John Millson was present. The tree does not exist anymore. There is a memorial tree in the park for David Buck who was a volunteer for the AIDS Committee of Windsor before his death in 1996. WERA is working with Pozitive Pathways to create a permanent monument in the park in the future.", "image": "/photos/fam.png"}
