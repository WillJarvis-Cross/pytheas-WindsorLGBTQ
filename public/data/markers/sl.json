Two young men age, 18 and 20 were charged with the murder of Henderson in his apartment and leaving a knife stuck in his neck.", "The two young men first met Henderson when he picked them up in Cambridge, Ontario, when they were both hitchhiking. The three of them got along and Henderson dropped them off in London and asked them if they were ever in Windsor to look him up. They came to Windsor and looked him up. They went to his apartment “crashed” for the night. Next morning Henderson bought them breakfast at Biff’s. They toured the city that day and ended up going back to Henderson’s apartment the next night. Before they went to the apartment the two young men bought PCP and took it at the apartment. The whole defense of the case was that the 18-year-old was “temporarily insane” because he experienced “homosexual panic” when Henderson supposedly grabbed his crotch in the apartment. This is when the 18-year-old grabbed a bottle, hit him over the head and then started to punch, kick and stab him repeatedly leaving the knife in his neck, and then stealing a suitcase with his cloths and binoculars.  Henderson was found by the police in his underwear and t-shirt on his bed.  There were empty beer bottles all around the body.  The psychiatrist Dr. Donald Nassr argued that the 18-year-old experienced “latent homosexual tendencies.” The 18-year-old talked about the “several homosexual advances made towards him” in the past.  Nassr told the jury that “if a person is a latent homosexual, he could react quite violently if touched by another man, regardless of if the act was expected or not.” Both young men were found guilty. The 18-year-old who stabbed Henderson was sentenced to life imprisonment. The twenty-year-old was found guilty of manslaughter and given four years.  Two years later an appeals court overturned the verdict because the “judge didn’t tell the jury that drunkenness can produce a state of insanity.”  The court cut a deal with the 18-year-old (now 20) and got four years for manslaughter."], "timeline": null, "image": "/photos/sl1.JPG"}
